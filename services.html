									<h3>Music Lessons</h3>
									<h4>Private Harp Lessons</h4>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/HarpLessons.png" alt="" /></span>Naomi Jackson is a classically trained harpist who professionally performs for special events and weddings. 
Beginning with Celtic and Folk genres, Naomi primarily studied Classical repertoire at the Conservatory following the RCM method. However, Naomi enjoys playing most genres, including:  Contemporary, Jazz, Film Scores, Pop, and more!
Naomi's musical background includes two-time gold medalist for the Royal Conservatory of Music's practical harp exams and private study under Ontario's top harpists in Orchestra and performance. Among Naomi's musical experiences are: recordings, Orchestra, and chamber groups, in addition to solo and duet performances. <br><br>

Naomi's teaching approach strongly emphasizes musical theory and harp technique. Each lesson is personally tailored to the student's goals and learning style.<br>
Nothing gives Naomi more joy than seeing her students excel and achieve their personal goals! <br><br>

For private Harp lessons and/or music theory lessons, don't hesitate to get in touch with Naomi! </p>

									<h4>Private Cello Lessons</h4>
									
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/CelloLessons.png" alt="" /></span>Heather has studied the cello for nearly a decade. The depth and warmth of the cello has always been fascinating to her. The appreciation of film scores led her to pursue the cello as it was clearly the staple of some of the best movie themes. Apart from the hundreds of weddings she has played for, Heather has been a part of music recordings, traveling orchestras, and in 2019 performed with KYGO at VELD.<br><br>

Heather offers cello lessons for all ages and musical backgrounds. Her focus is teaching the basics of the cello, encouraging good posture and technique, and molding each class to the student's goals and capabilities. Celtic and classical genres have shaped Heather's musical training, but she will happily teach other genres of music if desired.
